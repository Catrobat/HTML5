# Getting Started #

To get ready for development quickly you should start by following some simple instructions:

1. git clone \<repository\>
2. get to know the code by exploring all the files of the project carefully
3. debug the code by setting some breakpoints at some interesting positions (e.g. Client/pocketCode/scripts/compontents/gameEngine.js)
4. use remote debugging to debug the player on your mobile device (e.g. Google Chrome)
